Its main characteristics are \u201ctrial and error\u201d and \u201crelated reward.\u201d A hierarchical reinforcement learning method based on action subrewards is proposed to solve the problem of \u201ccurse of dimensionality,\u201d which means that the states space will grow exponentially in the number of features and low convergence speed. The method can reduce state spaces greatly and choose actions with favorable purpose and efficiency so as to optimize reward function and enhance convergence speed. Apply it to the online learning in Tetris game, and the experiment result shows that the convergence speed of this algorithm can be enhanced evidently based on the new method which combines hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm and action subrewards. The \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d problem is also solved to a certain extent with hierarchical method. All the performance with different parameters is compared and analyzed as well.",

        "abstract": "The control of self-driving cars has received growing attention recently. Although existing research shows promising results in the vehicle control using video from a monocular dash camera, there has been very limited work on directly learning vehicle control from motion-based cues. Such cues are powerful features for visual representations, as they encode the perpixel movement between two consecutive images, allowing a system to effectively map the features into the control signal. The authors propose a new framework that exploits the use of a motion-based feature known as optical flow extracted from the dash camera and demonstrates that such a feature is effective in significantly improving the accuracy of the control signals. The proposed framework involves two main components. The flow predictor, as a self-supervised deep network, models the underlying scene structure from consecutive frames and generates the optical flow. The controller, as a supervised multi-task deep network, predicts both steer angle and speed. The authors demonstrate that the proposed framework using the optical flow features can effectively predict control signals from a dash camera video. Using the Cityscapes data set, the authors validate that the system prediction has errors as low as 0.0130 rad/s on steer angle and 0.0615 m/s on speed, outperforming existing research.",

        "abstract": "The collaboration productively interacting between multi-agents has become an emerging issue in real-world applications. In reinforcement learning, multi-agent environments present challenges beyond tractable issues in single-agent settings. This collaborative environment has the following highly complex attributes: sparse rewards for task completion, limited communications between each other, and only partial observations. In particular, adjustments in an agent's action policy result in a nonstationary environment from the other agent's perspective, which causes high variance in the learned policies and prevents the direct use of reinforcement learning approaches. Unexpected social loafing caused by high dispersion makes it difficult for all agents to succeed in collaborative tasks. Therefore, we address a paradox caused by the social loafing to significantly reduce total returns after a certain timestep of multi-agent reinforcement learning. We further demonstrate that the collaborative paradox in multi-agent environments can be avoided by our proposed effective early stop method leveraging a metric for social loafing.",

        "abstract": "Despite great progress in autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation, the technical challenges within this space are still considerable when it comes to successful integration of AVs into complex real\u2010world environments. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a new semantic proto\u2010reinforcement learning (SP\u2010RL) method for dynamic path planning and real\u2010time obstacle avoidance of an autonomous car that can be adapted to various weather conditions in localization\u2010deficient environments, while predicting the human intentions of different shapes on road. This approach seeks to improve navigation capability of AV in dynamic and unstructured environments, as well as to address real\u2010time detection and avoidance response for obstacles more promptly while being able to adapt its decision\u2010making system based on weather condition by using the semantic graph network (SGN) within segmentation process therefore enhanced version configured with prototype\u2010based reinforcement learning (PRL). This innovation is new competitive edge compared previous existing approaches. Dynamic SGN is used to segment challenging 3D and free space environments, so that the AV can comprehend highly unintuitive areas like parking lots, construction site conditionals, or off\u2010road scenarios. At the same time, PRL is used to help real\u2010time decision\u2010making so the AV can quickly and precisely respond unexpected obstacles or changing environments. This approach is confirmed to be effective by extensive testing in the CARLA simulation environment, showing substantial improvement of AV navigation capability. This work demonstrates an exciting step towards solving the most fundamental problems faced by autonomous vehicles and could help to ensure that future AV systems are safer, more robust, and adaptable than current ones. It is appliable for urban areas which represent high volumes of pedestrians and vehicles, industrial sites with changing conditions that may be unpredictable at times or the challenging off\u2010road areas in rural geographies where typical terrains are rough, uneven, rugged yet not wellstructured. The model is robust to diverse weather conditions that make AV operations more reliable and safer. The model was tested on root mean square error (RMSE), computational time, no crash, obstacles avoidance, and success rate obtaining overall 98\\%.",

        "abstract": "Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has become a typical paradigm for the flocking motion of UAV swarm in dynamic, stochastic environments. However, sim-to-real problems, such as reality gap, training efficiency, and safety issues, restrict the application of MADRL in flocking motion scenarios. To address these problems, we first propose a digital twin (DT)-enabled training framework. With the assistance of high-fidelity digital twin simulation, effective policies can be efficiently trained. Based on the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, we then design the learning approach for flocking motion with matching observation space, action space, and reward function. Afterward, we employ a distributed flocking center estimation algorithm based on position consensus. The estimated center is used as a policy input to improve the aggregation behavior. Moreover, we introduce a repulsion scheme, which applies an additional repulsion force to the action to prevent UAVs from colliding with neighbors and obstacles. Simulation results show that our method performs well in maintaining flocking formation and avoiding collisions, and has better decision-making ability in near-realistic environments.",

        "abstract": "When deploying mobile robots in real\u2010world scenarios, such as airports, train stations, hospitals, and schools, collisions with pedestrians are intolerable and catastrophic. Motion safety becomes one of the most fundamental requirements for mobile robots. However, until now, efficient and safe robot navigation in such dynamic environments is still an open problem. The critical reason is that the inconsistency between navigation efficiency and motion safety is greatly intensified by the high dynamics and uncertainties of pedestrians. To face the challenge, this paper proposes a safe deep reinforcement learning algorithm named Conflict\u2010Averse Safe Reinforcement Learning (CASRL) for autonomous robot navigation in dynamic environments. Specifically, it first separates the collision avoidance sub\u2010task from the overall navigation task and maintains a safety critic to evaluate the safety/risk of actions. Later, it constructs two task\u2010specific but modelagnostic policy gradients for goal\u2010reaching and collision avoidance sub\u2010tasks to eliminate their mutual interference. Then, it further performs a conflict\u2010averse gradient manipulation to address the inconsistency between two sub\u2010tasks. Finally, extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the superiority of CASRL. Simulation results show an average 8.2\\% performance improvement over the vanilla baseline in eight groups of dynamic environments, which is further extended to 13.4\\% in the most challenging group. Besides, forty real\u2010world experiments fully illustrated that the CASRL could be successfully deployed on a real robot.",
